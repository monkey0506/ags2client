This project provides the basic setup required to use PC game clients
like Steam or GOG Galaxy with Adventure Game Studio, but is intended
as an interface only and is not complete or functional by itself. The
purpose of this project is to allow easy replacement of any
proprietary or closed-source client plugins (e.g., AGSteam) as well
as creating a common interface for developers.

********************
UNIFIED CLIENT NAME:
********************

Client plugins using AGS2Client can now take advantage of the macro
AGS2CLIENT_UNIFIED_CLIENT_NAME at plugin build-time. If this macro
is defined when you build your plugin, then the generated script
headers for AGS will use the name "AGS2Client" for your plugin,
intead of "AGSteam" or "AGSGalaxy" (etc.). This allows you to replace
a call such as:

    AGSteam.IsAchievementAchieved("ACHIEVEMENT_NAME");

With:

    AGS2Client.IsAchievementAchieved("ACHIEVEMENT_NAME");

The benefit of this is that if you have two (or more) plugins, such
as AGSteam and AGSGalaxy, that have the same achievement set up on
the client backend websites (e.g., "ACHIEVEMENT_NAME"), then you can
toggle between building for Steam and building for GOG Galaxy by
simply enabling the appropriate plugin (and disabling the other one).
There is no longer a necessity to have separate AGS scripts for each
client! (NOTE: Galaxy requires a unique initialization process, more
info is included with that plugin's README)

This means you can turn:

    #ifdef AGSteam_VERSION
    AGSteam.SetAchievement("ACHIEVEMENT_NAME");
    #endif // AGSteam_VERSION
    #ifdef AGSGalaxy_VERSION
    AGSGalaxy.SetAchievement("ACHIEVEMENT_NAME");
    #endif // AGSGalaxy_VERSION

Much more simply (and readably) into:

    #ifdef AGS2Client_VERSION
    AGS2Client.SetAchievement("ACHIEVEMENT_NAME");
    #endif // AGS2Client

And this will work for Steam, GOG Galaxy, or even if both plugins
are disabled! (NOTE: Separate versions of these client plugins are
provided. This method works only with the "UNIFIED" version and may
not work if you simply "grab" the DLL from another game. See client
plugin READMEs for more details)
