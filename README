This project provides the basic setup required to use PC game clients
like Steam or GOG Galaxy with Adventure Game Studio, but is intended
as an interface only and is not complete or functional by itself. The
purpose of this project is to allow easy replacement of any
proprietary or closed-source client plugins (e.g., AGSteam) as well
as creating a common interface for developers.
